# PCA_1
Using PCA create a face recognition system. To
implement this, you can use LFW_peoples dataset provided in the scikit-learn library. Given
this dataset, use only those classes that have a minimum (use min_faces_per_person
= 70, resize = 0.4 ) 70 images (should give you only 11 classes). Given this subset
of images, apply PA to obtain the corresponding eigen face for each class. You can
additionally train a classifier for recognition purpose.
